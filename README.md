#Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic
##Overview
This project focuses on detecting unusual patterns or anomalies in network traffic data, which can help identify potential security threats or system failures. The techniques used for anomaly detection include Isolation Forest and k-means clustering.

##Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be downloaded from here.

##Preprocessing and Anomaly Detection
The following preprocessing steps and anomaly detection techniques were applied:

##Preprocessing:

Separated numerical and categorical features
Imputed missing values for numerical features with mean
Encoded categorical features using Label Encoding
Normalized numerical features using StandardScaler
##Anomaly Detection:

Isolation Forest
k-means Clustering
##Conclusion
After visualizing the anomalies detected by both the Isolation Forest and k-means clustering algorithms, the following conclusions were drawn:

##Anomalies Detected by Isolation Forest:

The anomalies detected by the Isolation Forest are spread across the dataset.
##Anomalies Detected by k-means Clustering:

The anomalies detected by k-means clustering form a distinct cluster from the rest of the data.
Recommendations:
##Further Investigation:

Investigate the anomalies detected by both algorithms to determine the root cause and whether they represent potential security threats or system failures.
Tuning the Model:

Adjust the parameters of the Isolation Forest and k-means algorithms to improve the detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
##Continuous Monitoring:

Implement a continuous monitoring system to detect and respond to anomalies in real-time to enhance the network security and system reliability.
##Feature Importance:

Identify the most significant features contributing to the anomalies and focus on monitoring and securing these aspects of the network traffic.
